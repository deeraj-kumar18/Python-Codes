189. Rotate Array   https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/description/
Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

In previous solution, we were using extra space of an array of size d. 
In this solution we will make Space complexity O(1)
