75. Sort Colors  https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
 
Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 300
nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.

# Brute Force Approach
'''
Sort using any sorting technique. Preferably with less time complexity.
ex. Merge Sort O(n log n) , O(n)'''
def sort_bruteforce(arr):
    # Using Bubble Sort
    n=len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n-i-1):
            if arr[j]>arr[j+1]:
                arr[j],arr[j+1]=arr[j+1],arr[j]
    print(arr)

a=[1,5,6,4,2,7,8,0,9]
sort_bruteforce(a)
