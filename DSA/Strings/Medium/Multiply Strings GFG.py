Multiply two strings        https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/multiply-two-strings/1?page=2&sortBy=submissions

Difficulty: Medium

Given two numbers as strings s1 and s2. Calculate their Product.

Note: The numbers can be negative and You are not allowed to use any built-in function or convert the strings to integers. There can be zeros in the begining of the numbers. You don't need to specify '+' sign in the begining of positive numbers.

Example 1:
Input:
s1 = "0033"
s2 = "2"
Output:
66

Example 2:
Input:
s1 = "11"
s2 = "23"
Output:
253

Expected Time Complexity: O(n1* n2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n1 + n2); where n1 and n2 are sizes of strings s1 and s2 respectively.

Constraints:
1 ≤ length of s1 and s2 ≤ 103
